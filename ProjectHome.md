TCSitc is a torque vectoring (yaw) controller. It allows to read values of an array of potentiometer, ensure that values are plausible, independently control positive and negative torque for two motors (allowing regenerative braking) by CAN or via analog signals. It was developed to be compliant with the Formula SAE/Student Electric 2012 rules.

The torque vectoring algorithms haven't been implemented yet.

The boards schematics's and Eagle PCB layouts are available under the source tab, in our SVN repository.
